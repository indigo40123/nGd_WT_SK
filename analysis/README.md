# Refactored WT Analysis Code

This directory contains a refactored version of the WT analysis code using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The original procedural code has been restructured into classes with proper inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## OOP Concepts Applied

1. **Inheritance**: Base classes define common functionality that is inherited by specialized subclasses
2. **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes
3. **Polymorphism**: Common interfaces are defined for different implementations
4. **Abstraction**: Abstract base classes define interfaces for concrete implementations
5. **Method Chaining**: Fluent interface pattern for running analysis steps

## Code Structure

The refactored code is organized into the following modules:

- `data_handler.py`: Classes for handling data operations
  - `DataHandler`: Abstract base class for data handling
  - `RootDataHandler`: Handler for ROOT file data
  - `RunDataHandler`: Handler for run data and file operations

- `merger.py`: Classes for merging operations
  - `Merger`: Abstract base class for merging operations
  - `SingleDayMerger`: Class for merging files by single day
  - `PlusMinusSevenDayMerger`: Class for merging files with Â±7 days range

- `fitter.py`: Classes for fitting operations
  - `Fitter`: Abstract base class for fitting operations
  - `LinearFitter`: Class for linear fitting with two parameters
  - `FixedYInterceptFitter`: Class for linear fitting with fixed y-intercept

- `plotter.py`: Classes for plotting operations
  - `Plotter`: Abstract base class for plotting operations
  - `EfficiencyDistancePlotter`: Class for plotting efficiency vs distance
  - `WTTrendPlotter`: Class for plotting WT trend

- `analysis.py`: Main class for orchestrating the analysis workflow
  - `WTAnalysis`: Main class that coordinates all operations

- `run_analysis.py`: Script to run the analysis with command line arguments

## How to Use

### Running the Full Analysis

To run the full analysis with default parameters:

```bash
python -m analysis.refactored.run_analysis
```

To specify custom paths:

```bash
python -m analysis.refactored.run_analysis /path/to/workdir /path/to/runsum.dat
```

### Using Individual Components

You can also use individual components of the refactored code in your own scripts:

```python
from analysis.refactored.data_handler import RunDataHandler
from analysis.refactored.merger import SingleDayMerger
from analysis.refactored.fitter import LinearFitter
from analysis.refactored.plotter import WTTrendPlotter

# Initialize data handler
data_handler = RunDataHandler(workdir, runsum_path)
data, workdir, file_list = data_handler.read_data()

# Create and run merger
merger = SingleDayMerger(data, workdir, file_list)
merger.create_merge_script()
merger.execute_merge_script()

# Perform fitting
fitter = LinearFitter(workdir)
fitter.perform_fitting()

# Create plot
plotter = WTTrendPlotter()
plotter.create_plot()
plotter.show_plot()
```

### Using the WTAnalysis Class

The `WTAnalysis` class provides a convenient way to run the entire analysis workflow:

```python
from analysis.refactored.analysis import WTAnalysis

# Create analysis object
analysis = WTAnalysis(workdir, runsum_path)

# Run full analysis
analysis.run_analysis()

# Or run individual steps
analysis.setup()
analysis.merge_files()
analysis.perform_fitting()
analysis.create_plots()
```

## Benefits of the Refactored Code

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand, modify, and extend
4. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
5. **Flexibility**: Different implementations can be swapped easily

## Dependencies

The refactored code has the same dependencies as the original code:
- uproot3
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib
